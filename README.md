# rustTemplate

This is a sample template for other web-based projects.

This repo contains the basic building blocks for pretty much any kind of web service you'd work on.
Imagine building the same damn features like login, user authentication, and registration in the database every single time you start a new project.
That shit gets old real quick and sucks hard, r8?

So instead of wasting time rewriting the same boilerplate over and over, just use this as your starter. It saves your time, your sanity, and keeps things less messy when youâ€™re building the real features that actually matter.
